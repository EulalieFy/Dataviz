# Mini Vast Challenge 2018

This project was made to answer to the data visualization contest : [Mini Vast Challenge](http://www.vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2018)

Kasios is accused of damaging the bird's living area of the Lekagul Nature Reserve. Our goal is to use Data Visualization, Signal Processing (for birds sounds analysis) and machine learning to determine if they are guilty of fleeing the birds from the reserves. The type of birds we are interested in is Rose-crested Blue Pipit.

In the Notebook: you'll find the first map we did

In the Notebook: you'll find our first sound analysis, and how we chose the most representative sound for each type of birds

In the Notebook: you'll find our machine learning predictions and final conclusions

In this folder: the Dashboard we used to double-check predictions and draw conclusions.
